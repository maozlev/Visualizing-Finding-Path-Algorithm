# Path-Finding-Visualiation

## Writing an Algorithm is very nice but the real fun is to see it!

This project is a visualization tool for the Dijkstra's path finding algorithm. It allows the user to select a start node and an end node, and then displays the shortest path between the two nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm. The user can also add or remove walls to change the layout of the grid.

## Getting Started
To run this project, follow these steps:
* Clone or download the repository
* Navigate to the project directory in your terminal
* Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies
* Run npm start to start the development server
* The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

## Features
* Select start and end nodes with buttons
* Add or remove walls to change the grid layout
* Visualization of Dijkstra's algorithm finding the shortest path between the start and end nodes
## Technologies
This project was built with:
* React
* React Hooks
* Dijkstra's algorithm
